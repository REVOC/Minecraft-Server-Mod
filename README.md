hMod
====================
hMod is a server mod for the Minecraft Beta server software. This is only the source code, if you don't know how to use this you won't find it useful.

Volition21's fork: It's literally just a Beta 1.2 server. I'm just setting up a nice clean source I can work with.

Compiling
---------
Uuuuh new stuff using gradle.


minecraft_servero.jar
---------
Gradle won't build if you don't have it, go into jarjar and run jarar.jar with the paramters in jarjar.bat
