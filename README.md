VhMod
====================
VhMod is a server mod for the Minecraft Beta server software. This is only the source code, if you don't know how to use this you won't find it useful.

Just a retroactive build of hMod with some changes along the way for CI compatibility and the new Mojang API.

Compiling
---------
gradle build - will automatically decompile minecraft_server.jar, and build the project with current commit ID.
